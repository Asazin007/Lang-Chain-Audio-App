Here, for our tutorial example, we will be using an mp3 audio file link. The audio is an interview with Peter DiCarlo, an associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, discussing the impact of Canadian wildfires on air quality in the United States. The interview covers the factors contributing to the spread of smoke, the health risks associated with high levels of particulate matter in the air, vulnerable populations, and the potential for worsening conditions due to climate change.
